I created to the basic calculater using python file.
then open command prompt  or windows powershell type the command 
pip install pyinstaller
because it is a tool that allows you to bundle Python programs into standalone executables (like .exe files on Windows), which means:

No Python Required: The executable can run on a computer without needing Python to be installed. PyInstaller packages your script, along with the Python interpreter and any dependencies, into a single file.

Distribute Easily: You can share the .exe file with others, and they can run your Python application without installing Python or any required libraries.

Cross-Platform Support: PyInstaller can generate executables for different operating systems, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it easier to distribute your Python app.

 after installing Navigate to the script directory.go to the correct location of python file.

type the command : pyinstaller --oneword --windowed calculater.py 

this comand convert all python file into one file and create a application calculater.exe file


if you want run the application go to the python folder ,cmd created to dist folder inside the calcculater application file
